# LF Energy Functional Architecture Model

***Important Note: “The LF Energy ArchiMate Special Interest Group is currently on hold, and development of the LF Energy Architecture Model has been discontinued.***

The repos in this github org contains Functional Architecture Model in Archimate language. 

# Introduction
The LF Energy members EPRI, RTE, Alliander, and Aachen University have joined together in LF Energy Archimate Working Group to create an architecture model for [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/).

[LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) is an open-source foundation focused on the power systems sector, hosted within The Linux Foundation. [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) provides a neutral, collaborative community to build the shared digital investments that will transform the world’s relationship to energy.

The goal of the LF Energy Architecture Model is to become the place to go for sharing references architectures and project architectures within the LF Energy community. It aims to clarify the ecosystem of LF Energy: wherefore can the LF Energy projects be used, how they interact together, and examples of how they can be adopted in reference architectures. This will provide a clear and deep understanding of how the  LF Energy projects contribute to business functions and help the project adoption, foster synergies between projects, and limit the overlap between projects.

For more information, please watch [the special episode of TFiR: State of Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RO9GsljPUw) where Swapnil Bhartiya sits down with Prince Singh, Solution Architect at Alliander and Benoît Jeanson, Enterprise Architect at RTE, and talk about LF Energy Architecture Model and how it makes it easier for anybody in the world to identify LF Energy Projects that are of interest to them and how they can be integrated into their organization.

# View 
The model can be viewed [here without the need to install Archi](https://lfenergyarchitecturemodel.github.io/lfenergyfunctionalarchitecturemodel/).

# Edit  
To contribute to the LF Energy Archimate models you need [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/). 

## Step-by-step guide for Archi
